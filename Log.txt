I tried didn't ctrl+c and ctrl+v the sample code except the emojis but that didn't work probably because I tried to added something on top of it. 
But when I created a new file and pasted the damn code it fricking worked.
So, remember kds be sure to always plagiarize everything you don't understand :D
